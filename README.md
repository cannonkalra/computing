# Computing


This is aimed at uncovering all layers of software to hardware. Python to CPython to RISC-V ISA


1. Learning to understand how application program is compiled and managed by a runtime to allocate memory. Understand Python Virtual Machine. 

2. How a C Implementation of Python helps interpreting language constructs.

3. How a simple C program differs from a Python program but function the same

4. How instructions look like in the virtual memory of a linux process

5. How RISC-V ISA interprets the Instructions by understanding Assembly langauge

6. How to boot a Linux on RISC-V QEMU VM

7. How to run a bootloader on QEMU VM to boot first sector for the kernel to boot up

8. How docker engine calls for a chroot/process/volume isolation



# Instructions


All the binaries required to run the projects and chapters will be provided is docker images


```bash

```

# TODO
- [x] RISCV QEMU
- [ ] Leaner Dockerfile


# Resoruces
